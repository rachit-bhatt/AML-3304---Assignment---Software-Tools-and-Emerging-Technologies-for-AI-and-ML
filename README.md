# AML-3304---Assignment---Software-Tools-and-Emerging-Technologies-for-AI-and-ML
Our group will set up a Slack workspace and GitHub repo, integrate ZenHub, and manage two sprints with Epics and issues. We’ll build a Slack bot, resolve a GitHub merge conflict, and close an issue via commit. Lastly, we’ll submit the GitHub and Slack URLs along with screenshots of our Sprint 1 burndown and velocity charts.
